# WSRegret-OKS
Source codes of algorithms and datasets for our paper
"Worst-case Regret Analysis of Computationally Budgeted Online Kernel Selection",
accepted in ACML2021 Journal Track (Machine Mearning Journal).

table 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain all of the codes.
classification contains the classification datasets,
regression contains the regression datasets.

We implement algorithms with R on a Windows machine with 2.5 GHz Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU 
(table 4 and table 6) and on a Windows machine with 2.5 GHz Core(TM) i7-4710MQ CPU 
(table 5 and table 7).

We execute each experiment 20 times with random permutation of all datasets and average all of the results.

The datasets are downloaded from WEKA and UCI machine learning repository https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/.

To execute the algorithms,
the path of codes and datasets should be set to "F:/experiment/ML 2021/...".
More details can be found in the codes.
The path can also be reset by changing the codes.
